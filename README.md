"Developed a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and amenities, leveraging Python and Scikit-learn. Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and regression algorithms to ensure accuracy and reliability. Visualized data trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn, providing actionable insights for real estate applications."

Steps:
1. Problem Definition
Clearly defined the goal: to predict house prices based on various input features like location, size, and amenities.
2. Data Collection
Obtained a dataset from a reliable source (e.g., Kaggle or public housing data).
Explored the dataset to understand its structure, features, and missing values.
3. Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values using techniques like mean/median imputation.
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., location) using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
Standardized numerical data to ensure consistency across features.
4. Data Visualization
Used tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize relationships between features and the target variable (price).
Plotted correlations, scatter plots, and histograms to identify trends and outliers.
5. Model Selection and Training
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Chose algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting for modeling.
Trained the model using the training data and fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance.
6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and RÂ² score.
Compared the performance of different models to select the best one.
7. Deployment (Optional)
Converted the trained model into a deployable format using tools like Flask or Streamlit.
Built a user-friendly interface to allow users to input data and get price predictions.
8. Conclusion
The model successfully predicted house prices with high accuracy, providing insights that could assist real estate professionals and buyers.
